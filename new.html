				<h2>What's New</h2>
				
				<dl>
					<dt>July 4, 2025 &#8212; New "partial pass" status</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>It is now possible to set success criteria to a partial pass status. This status better 
							reflects if some effort has been made to meet the requirements. The reasons why a partial
							pass is being given should always be cited in the note field.</p>
						<p>Publications will still fail conformance when criteria only partially pass since not 
							fully meeting success criteria is a failure in WCAG 2.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>July 4, 2025 &#8212; Enhanced accessibility information in reports</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Reports now include a new accessibility tab that incorporates the display statements
							defined in the <a 
								href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/a11y/metadata-display-guide/guidelines/">Accessibility 
								Metadata Display Guide for Digital Publications 2.0</a>.</p>
						<p>This tab turns the accessibility metadata reported into a set of human-readable statements.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>July 4, 2025 &#8212; Consolidated metadata tab</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>As the accessibility metadata that can be expressed in the EPUB package document and in ONIX
							records has largely converged, the Discovery and Distribution metadata tabs have been 
							consolidated into a new Metadata tab.</p>
						<p>The choice of which format to generate is now provided when you choose to output metadata
							tags from the SMART tool.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>July 4, 2025 &#8212; New metadata for evaluators</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Reporting tab has been updated to provide a more comprehensive set of fields. It is now
							possible to set the evaluation date, indicate if any exemptions apply to a publication, and
							specify a contact email for more information about the accessibility of a publication.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>July 4, 2025 &#8212; New output method</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The options to output reports and metadata have been consolidated in a new dialog box. To
							generate these outputs, click the "create outputs" button (visually, a plus sign inside a 
							circle) at the top right of the evaluation interface.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>May 8, 2024 &#8212; Updated report format</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The evaluation reports now have sticky headers so that mouse users do not have to scroll
							back to the top to change tabs. This change does not affect existing reports.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>May 3, 2024 &#8212; Updated distribution metadata</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The layout of the Distribution tab has been updated to include the descriptions for
							each onix value. In addition, it is now possible to add a
							<code>ProductFormFeatureDescription</code> for onix fields that accept additional
							information.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>March 19, 2024 &#8212; Accessibility metadata wizard</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A new metadata wizard is available for beta testing on the Discovery tab. The wizard
							leads you through a series of questions about the publication to produce the metadata.
							Notably, it will add access modes and sufficient access modes based on the responses
							given.</p>
						
						<p>Feedback about the wizard is welcome, not only for bug reports but also for improvements
							that could be made. Please open issues in the <a 
								href="https://github.com/daisy/ace-smart/issues" target="_blank">SMART GitHub tracker</a>.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>February 23, 2024 &#8212; Added specification to all reports</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>In the generated reports, the version of the EPUB Accessibility specification and WCAG
							tested against was only reported if the publication passed. This information is now
							available regardless of the outcome. The specification is also on a separate line from
							the test status.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>September 21, 2023 &#8212; Updated distribution metadata</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Distribution metadata tab has been updated to match the new values available in ONIX code list
							issue 62. Included in the new release are fields for indicating conformance to the new EPUB
							Accessibility 1.1 specification and also for complying with the European Accessibility Act.
							The new release also includes many new fields for accessibility features as well as more
							descriptive titles for many of the codes.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>May 26, 2023 &#8212; Updated discovery metadata</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Discovery metadata tab has been updated to include values for the latest accessibility
							features: ARIA roles, open and closed captions, page break markers, and page navigation. It
							is also now possible to state that publications do not contain flashing, sound, or motion
							simulation hazards.</p>
						<p>The Discovery tab also now includes more robust validation of the metadata fields.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>May 18, 2023 &#8212; Adding evaluator metadata associations</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The evaluator metadata generated in the Result tab now includes associations
							between the fields. The evaluator is linked to the conformance result, and
							the evaluator's credential and report is linked to them.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>May 18, 2023 &#8212; Added certifier credential field</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Result tab now includes a field for inputting a credential. This metadata
							is currently only used to generate metadata for the EPUB package document, but
							its use may be expanded to the final reports in the future.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>November 18, 2022 &#8212; Experimental support for WCAG 2.2</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>SMART now supports evaluating EPUB publications against the <a 
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/CR-WCAG22-20220906/">WCAG 2.2 Candidate Recommendation</a>.
							Evaluators are advised to only use this option for experimentation at this time, however.
							WCAG 2.2 may change again before becoming a final recommendation.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>October 26, 2022 &#8212; Unlimited access</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>We have removed the restriction on creating reports for non-
							<a href="https://daisy.org/about-us/membership/inclusive-publishing-partners/">Inclusive
								Publishing Partner</a> members. SMART is now available without restriction to everyone.</p>
						<p>Existing accounts that were restricted to two reports a month have been migrated to unlimited
							access. It is not necessary to create a new account.
						<p>The login page has also been updated to better introduce the tool to users.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>August 15, 2022 &#8212; Updated EPUB Accessibility 1.1 support</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The EPUB Accessibility 1.1 specification made a couple of significant changes during the
							Candidate Recommendation phase. The conformance statement made in the
							<code>dcterms:conformsTo</code> property now uses a more human-readable pattern. The
							<code>accessibilitySummary</code> property was also changed from required to recommended
							to include.</p>
						<p>The SMART tool now incorporates these changes in the experimental support for the
							standard.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>August 15, 2022 &#8212; Ace support updated</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The SMART tool now handles errors from the aXe 4.4 rule set reported by Ace.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>July 11, 2022 &#8212; Support for EPUB Accessibility 1.1</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Ace SMART now includes support for evaluating EPUB publications against the new Accessibility 1.1
							specification!</p>
						<p>On the Conformance tab, you can now select the 1.1 specification from the options at the top
							to begin an evaluation. Selecting this version will also allow you to change the WCAG
							conformance field to 2.1. SMART has also been updated to output the new conformance
							strings for Accessibility 1.1 specification.
						<p>This feature is still considered experimental as the specification is not yet a W3C Recommendation
							(i.e., it is still possible that it will change).</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>July 11, 2022 &#8212; New statistics box</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Conformance tab now includes a statistic box that reports how many success criteria have
							passed, failed, are not applicable, and have not yet been checked. This box remains fixed as
							the page scrolls.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>July 11, 2022 &#8212; New ONIX values</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Distribution tab now includes support for ONIX Code List 196 values 25 through 29 and
							93.</p>
					</dd>

	<p>Check if the publication contains any multi-step processes &#8212; typically this will
		require a scripted form that the user completes over a series of steps.</p>
	<p>If the publication contains such a process, and it requires the user to re-input information
		from an earlier step (e.g., their username or address), the repeated information either needs
		to be autopopulated for the user or a means of selecting the previously entered information
		needs to be provided for this success criterion to pass.</p>
	<p class="sc-note">Note: Multi-step processes that require users to re-input information are 
		rarely found in EPUB publications. This success criterion primarily targets ecommerce and
		similar web sites that collect user information over a series of steps, typically broken
		over multiple form submissions to a server (e.g., first the shipping address is collected
		and then the billing address, which could be the same).</p>

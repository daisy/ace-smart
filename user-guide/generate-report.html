				<h2>Generating Reports</h2>
				
				<p>To create a final evaluation report, the first step is to open the outputs dialog. 
					To do so, click on the Create Outputs button in the evaluation interface.</p>
				
				<figure>
					<figcaption>Figure 1 &#8212; The Create Outputs button is a plus symbol in a circle. It is
						the first button in the set of application controls.</figcaption>
					<img src="images/eval_controls.png" width="550" alt="Report tab" />
				</figure>
				
				<p>Clicking on this button opens a new dialog containing the output options. The first set of
					controls under the Evaluation Report heading is for outputting reports.</p>

				</figure>
				
				<p>There are two buttons for generating a report:</p>
				
				<dl>
					<dt>Preview</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Preview button opens the report in a new browser window so that you can review it.
							This page is only temporary and cannot be bookmarked or its link sent to other people.
							It only exists as long as you keep the window open.</p>
						
						<p>If any errors are encountered while compiling the report, you will receive an alert and the
							errors will be listed in a message panel at the bottom of the page.</p>
						
						<div class="note">
							<p><strong>Note</strong>: Although saving the source of the preview page is possible,
								it is not recommended. Browsers may inject their own markup and scripts.</p>
						</div>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Create</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Create button results in a prompt to download the report locally to your computer. Your
							browser may automatically save the file to a specific location, such as a Downloads folder,
							but this default can be changed so you can pick the location and name (search for
							instructions for your preferred browser).</p>
						
						<p>As with previews, if any errors are encountered while compiling the report, you will receive
							an alert and the errors will be listed in a message panel at the bottom of the page.</p>
						
						<p>This report can be included in the EPUB publication or hosted on the web and linked to
							from the publication.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>
				
				<section id="options">
					<h4>Output Options</h4>
					
					<p>The SMART tool allows some customization of the final reports. Click on the Output Options
						link to open the options.</p>
					
					<figure>
						<figcaption>Figure 3 &#8212; Clicking the Output Options link reveals the option to configure
							which types of note are output.</figcaption>
						<img src="images/report_notes.png" alt="Output options" width="400"/>
					</figure>
					
					
					<p>Currently, only the types of notes to include in the final report is customizable, allowing
						different levels of reports to be generated for different audiences.</p>
					
					<p>By default, all notes are included in the output. It is also possible to selectively include
						messages:</p>
					
					<dl>
						<dt>Failure descriptions</dt>
						<dd>Failure descriptions are any messages input into the text field that automatically appears when
							a success criterion's status is set to Fail.</dd>
						
						<dt>Notes</dt>
						<dd>Notes are any messages input into the text field that automatically appears when the "Add note"
							checkbox for a success criterion is selected.</dd>
						
						<dt>None</dt>
						<dd>No notes are output.</dd>
					</dl>
				</section>
				
				<section id="reports">
					<h4>Reports</h4>
					
					<p>The report documents are broken up into four tabs.</p>
					
					<figure>
						<figcaption>Figure 4 &#8212; An accessibility report page. It includes overview,
							accessibility, conformance, and additional information tabs.</figcaption>
						<img src="images/a11y_report.png" alt="Smart report" width="500"/>
					</figure>
					
					<p>The default overview tab provides key information about the publication: its conformance
						status, the discoverability metadata, and who evaluated the publication.</p>
					
					<p>The accessibility tab provides a description of the accessibility of the publication
						based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/a11y/metadata-display-guide/guidelines/"
							>Accessibility Metadata Display Guide for Digital Publications</a>.</p>
					
					<p>The conformance tab contains a complete list of the statuses of each success criterion, and
						the additional information tab lists more general metadata about the publication (e.g., the
						format and when it was last modified).</p>
					
					<p>The additional information tab provides additional bibliographic information from the
						overview tab of the SMART tool.</p>
